    <h2 class="home"> Our Story </h2>
    <section class="content">
      <!-- Source: Mi Yang (client) -->
      <div class="text-content">
        <p> Coming to Cornell in 2018 to study then environment, far away from Beijing, Mi Yan has never thought one day his life was deeply bonded with cooking. Living in China for 30 years, Mi hadn’t cooked for himself. When he lived with his parents before went to university in Xi’an, his mom took care of cooking. When he spent four years in university, the dining halls were very convenient, with so many varieties and cheap. As a top university in Western China, the meals are subsided by government. A luxurious lunch only costed 1 US dollar.</p>
        <p> Like many other Chinese students in the US, they become a good cook when they start their life in the US. The pandemic even speeds up this process. Since the pandemic, Mi and his wife are very careful and didn’t go out to eat. After his wife was pregnant, the cooking tasks become Mi’s role. From this time, he realized that how time consuming it is to cook, especially a good Chinese dish. </p>
        <p> With the advancement of technology, so many industries have entered the era of robots. But the restaurant industry is still lagging. Can’t we use some technologies to change the industry? Mi and his team is exploring the possibilities. </p>

    <h2 class="home"> The Problem </h2>
    <section class="content">

      <q> The increasing cost of labor and labor shortage is hindering Chinese restaurants. </q>
      <ul>
        <li>Many operators have completely shut their doors due to staff shortages. More than 75% of restaurant operators report that recruiting and retaining employees is their top challenge, the highest level recorded in two decades, according to the National Restaurant Association.</li>
        <li> The taste of Chinese cuisine relies entirely on chefs. They are in charge of the ingredients, cooking times and temperatures, and the use of seasonings, which are all controlled by the chef’s personal experience. As a result, changing chefs can affect a restaurant a lot.</li>
        <li>There is a shift from Americanized dishes to more authentic Chinese dishes and flavors. Therefore, experienced and well-trained chefs are in high demand. The current immigration policies restrict skilled cooks from moving from China to work in the U.S.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="home"> Our Solution </h2>
    <section class="content" >
      <!-- Source: Mi Yang (client) -->
      <div class="text-content">
        <p> We use robots to help Chinese restaurants reduce labor costs and improve food quality.</p>
        <p> MiFood Tech is a kitchen robot startup that aims to provide automated solutions for Chinese restaurants and kitchens, and to reduce labor costs while maintaining a high quality of cuisine.</p>

        <p>Our intelligent woks are programmable. After restaurant employees store ingredients in the designated boxes, the woks will add cooking oil, drop specific  ingredients down, and stir and cook dishes automatically.</p>

        <p>Currently, we are developing our intelligent woks. To test the prototypes, we plan to launch our pilot restaurant “TANR” to service traditional Chinese dishes and rice bowls in downtown Ithaca next summer.
