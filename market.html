            <h2>Industry Outlook</h2>
            <h3>There is massive room for growth in the industry</h3>
            <p>The U.S Chinese restaurant industry's revenue is increasing at an annualized rate of 2.9%, and is predicted to be worth up to 17.7 billion dollars in 2025. Additionally, the recent boom of delivery and ghost kitchens is bringing more technology into these traditional spaces and primes the industry for MiFoodTech (first graph). Additionally, with wages in the industry consistently rising (second graph), the need to adopt technology or change current recruiting strategies has only become more apparent.</p>
