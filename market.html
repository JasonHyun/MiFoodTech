            <h2>Market Size</h2>
                <p>There is a substantial market size due to the strong demand for Asian cuisine in the U.S, Chinese in particular</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In fact, more than 42% of American adults consume Chinese cuisine a few times a year</li>
                    <li>There are more than 40,000 Chinese restaurants in the U.S. This number is greater than all the McDonald's, KFCs, Pizza Huts, Taco Bells, and Wendy's locations in America combined.</li>

            <h2>Industry Outlook</h2>
            <p>There is massive room for growth in the industry: The U.S Chinese restaurant industry's revenue is increasing at an annualized rate of 2.9%, and is predicted to be worth up to 17.7 billion dollars in 2025. Additionally, the recent boom of delivery and ghost kitchens is bringing more technology into these traditional spaces and primes the industry for MiFoodTech (first graph). Additionally, with wages in the industry consistently rising (second graph), the need to adopt technology or change current recruiting strategies has only become more apparent.</p>

            <h2>Labor Costs Comparison</h2>
            <p>
                This table shows the savings in labor costs by using our intelligent woks. Restaurant owners can benefit from their investment in the first year and save more in the following years. More than 70% of labor can be replaced by robots. Cooks will have time to prep instead of standing in front of the wok. Only a few minimal steps need to be done by a cook.
