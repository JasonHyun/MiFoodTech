    <h2> Competitor Benchmarking </h2>
    <h3> We are the only Chinese restaurant automation solution provider in the U.S.</h3>
    <div class = "unique">
        <div class = "whyus-info">
            <p>Compared to other companies in the market, we are dedicated to automation technologies for Chinese restaurants to address their challenges with labor and cooking standards. Besides using our built-in recipes, restaurants can easily program our robots from the graphical user interface to cook their signature dishes. Our system can save money for restaurants with reduced labor, training, and set-up standards which is essential for business growth. With less time spent on repetitive work, chefs can innovate new dishes and improve the quality of their cuisine.

    <h2> Our Technology </h2>
    <div class = "technology">
        <p> MiFood Tech is developing intelligent cooking robots that fit the needs of Chinese restaurants in the U.S. We are researching and developing an automated cooking wok, including a turbo cooking wok and tossing cooking wok. Later, we plan to develop automatic chopping machines and dish-serving machines integrated with Internet of Things.
        </p>

        <p> Software will also be developed to connect and program the intelligent hardware together and to manage orders from dine-in and take-out.

    <h2> Business Model </h2>
    <h3> We make money by selling cooking robots and charging subscription fees. </h3>

        <p> We will sell the automated kitchen solutions to Chinese restaurants in the U.S. According to customers’ needs and wants, we can customize our products to meet customer satisfaction. The price of an automated cooking robot will be between $6,000 to $12,000,  based on the analysis of our competitors’ prices. The cost of manufacturing the robot is 35% of the sale price. The managing software is charged by subscription. We plan to charge $99 per month to our restaurant customers.
