    <div class = "unique">
        <div class = "whyus-info info-mobile">
            <p>Compared to other companies in the market, we are dedicated to automation technologies for Chinese restaurants to address their challenges with labor and cooking standards. Besides using our built-in recipes, restaurants can easily program our robots from the graphical user interface to cook their signature dishes. Our system can save money for restaurants with reduced labor, training, and set-up standards which is essential for business growth.

    <h2> Our Technology </h2>
    <div class = "technology info-mobile">
        <p> MiFood Tech is developing intelligent cooking robots that fit the needs of Chinese restaurants in the U.S. We are researching and developing an automated cooking wok, including a turbo cooking wok and tossing cooking wok. Later, we plan to develop automatic chopping machines and dish-serving machines integrated with Internet of Things.
        </p>

        <p> Software will also be developed to connect and program the intelligent hardware together and to manage orders from dine-in and take-out.
