    <h2> Our Technology </h2>
    <div class = "technology info-mobile">
        <p> MiFood Tech is developing intelligent cooking robots that fit the needs of Chinese restaurants in the U.S. We are researching and developing an automated cooking wok, including a turbo cooking wok and tossing cooking wok. Later, we plan to develop automatic chopping machines and dish-serving machines integrated with Internet of Things.
        </p>

        <p> Software will also be developed to connect and program the intelligent hardware together and to manage orders from dine-in and take-out.
