# Client (Milestone 1)

## Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

Purpose: designing different robots to help prepare Chinese cuisine

Chinese food is very difficult and time consuming. The labor cost is increasing after the pandemic and Chinese restaurants depend on Chinese chefs. However, because of the immigration policy, Chinese chefs cannot work. MiFoodTech plans to solve this problem by designing robots to cook Chinese food.

The team includes hotelies, ECE, and CS students for marketing and robotics purposes. The plan is for the ECE and CS students to develop the software and hardware. There will be a talking machine, along with the cooking machines. The software will be able to facilitate management and can connect the robots to work automatically.

An example of a dish that will the robots will be able to make is fried shredded potato with green pepper. The idea is that a chef will no longer be needed, but the restaurant may need prepping staff. The use of robots will save lots of money.

The team is looking into the market size, customer acquisition strategy, and competition benchmark. In the future, we will work on prototype validation, R&D, and market expansion.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

The organization is special because the use of robots will replace the need of chefs and reduce labor costs. Looking at the competition, other companies have not yet developed fully automatic robots, which MiFoodTech is aiming towards.

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

MiFoodTech currently does not have a website. We would like a website introduce the problems and solutions to them, introduce the team, show the technology, and future steps.

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who is your site's target audience?

We would like investors to visit the site. Our site's target audience is investors.

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

MiFoodTech wants visitors to see their mission and technology, and hopes that  will want to become part of the founding team. We hope that user will invest in our company to help fund our progress.

6. What are your goals for this site?

Our goals for the site are to present information about our project that will attract investors.

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

We want a very simple, neat and clean website. We want brightly colored images on a simplistic website. Additionally, we want a big image on the homepage.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' sites? Why?

**Junzi**
https://www.junzi.kitchen/
Junzi is another chinese restaurant that already has 5 restaurants. We like this site because of how simple and clean it looks. There is a big image at the top that really displays the food.

**Canary Technologies**
https://www.canarytechnologies.com/
Canary technologies is a hotel company, and restaurant is a similar industry. We also like how simplistic the website is. Specifically, we like how the website includes problems and solutions, client testimonials, and other related companies on the homepage.

**Doordash**
https://www.doordash.com/
Doordash is a really popular company. The website also has a really large image at the top of the homepage. The website is simplistic and has bright images that are appealing and eye-catching.

9. How often would you like to meet or receive updates?

We would like to meet once a week.

9a. If yes would you prefer email, zoom, or other?

If you have any questions, we can talk over Slack. We do not have any preferences.

10. Are you going to provide content (images, etc.)for your site?

We don't have many images right now. You can search online and find images. The design of the website is most important, and we can change the images once we have more images. You can use images and text from the slides presentation on your website and contact me if you need more information.

11. Do you have any potential user interviewees you would like us to reach out to?

Not at the moment.


## Client Description (Milestone 1)

Our client is Mi Yan, a grad student who is hoping to launch his FoodTech startup soon. He is hoping to create and sell robotic kitchen assistants, specifically for Chinese restaurants. Our client meets the client rules in the project requirements because they are external. They are not one of our group, no team member in the group is a member of this organization, and none of us have a personal relationship with our client.


## Client Website (Milestone 1)

Our client wants a website that they can show to future potential investors and demonstrates their product well. They are hoping that, through the contents presented on the website, they will be able to not only show who they are as a team, but also what they hope to achieve in their future, as well as provide details about their projects. Accordingly, the website will be about the team's background and purpose, the members, and ongoing projects; the website will also be designed in order to convince potential investors to join their mission


## Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)

We plan on making 5 pages for the client as they suggested in the meeting. This will not be too big as we have 5 team members so each one of us can take ownership of one page. We also want to make sure to include everything that the client mentioned in the meeting as making sure that they get the website they need should be our first priority. Additionally, we want the website to portray what our client thinks investors should know in a way that is not too cluttered (meaning there is not too much on each page) and there is a lot of material in the slides that can be organized into about 5 pages.


## Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience. Be specific and justify why this audience is a cohesive group with regard to your client's site. This audience should not be overly broad nor arbitrarily specific. It should be a cohesive group with similar _goals_.

Our site's audience is potential investors in MiFoodTech. This is a cohesive group as any investors would want to know where their money is going and how it is being used. Therefore, the information they would be trying to find is similar across the board and can be organized in a  way to target MiFoodTech's website towards this audience.

### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)

### Interview Notes (Milestone 2)
> Interview at least 4 people from your audience. Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.

**Interviewee 1:**

Roopanshi Ramapal is a sophomore at Cornell University. She is studying Applied Economics and Management and is a member of the Cornell Venture Capital Club. She is a member of our intended audience as MiFoodTech would like us to make a website that they can show investors and she analyzes companies for her business club to invest in and learn about regularly and has knowledge of business concepts that we would need to feature on our website to attract investors.

1. Have you ever invested before? Have you ever invested in a restaurant?
    - Have you ever invested in a restaurant like MiTechFood?
    - If yes, what did you invest in most recently and why?
    - If not, ...
No- she has not personally invested before. However, she is explaining through the lens of someone who often looks at companies for her club as an analyst.


2. Did you seek out any information before deciding to invest?  If yes, what was that information? How did you obtain it?
    - What is the most important piece of information that influenced your decision to invest?
    - How did you feel about the {business, company, startup, etc} you decided to invest in?

She has not invested yet, but she says that when she is looking at companies, she would seek out market trends and how the industry is doing pre and post covid. She wants to know if a product is something that a market would even need (saturation?) and if a product is something that people would be open to implementing. She alsos say that she would want to see a lot more information about competitors and logistics of the product.


3. Is there any information you wish you had known about your investment beforehand or information you weren’t able to find?

She says that she finds it hard to find quantitative information about smaller companies, especially ones that are in a more niche industry like food tech.


5. What is an important piece of information that you always want to know before investing in a company, brand or restaurant?

Interviewee one says that when she is analyzing a company, she always wants to know about incumbents and how realistic it is for this small company to make a space and a name for themselves.

She mentions the Fintech industry: Paypal is the incumbent and they have literally 48% of the market share. She would only be looking at small startups that have a wild differentiating factor becuase brand and reputation, which incumbents already have is super valuable.


6. When investing, is learning about your investees background important? Why or why not?

Yes 100%. She wants to make sure that the investee is reputable and their past work has been successful. Especially for startups that she looks at (ie Seed and Series A), she does not know what profitability margins are and so she has to gain trust. She wants to see as many past transactions as possible.

7. (Optional) How long or how well do you have to know an individual or startup like MiTechFood before you would feel comfortable investing in them?

She would need to understand the business model completely and know each member of the team, not just the person running it. She also says that she needs to see a game plan and where her money would be going for the next few years.


8. Do you have any considerations or reservations, if any, about investing in MiFoodTech? Why or why not?

She thinks that she personally does not know as much about the foodtech industry as she would like to and wants to know more about how MiFoodTech fits in.


9. What haven’t I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

She re-emphasizes the differentiating factor. She wants to see an in depth analysis of how a company tackles an issue in the industry in comparison to other startups and incumbents.


**Interviewee 2:**


Iris Li, junior studying Computer Science, is a member of Cornell Cup Robotics. She works in system engineering. She is working on a lab assisted robot (like R2D2). She is a member of our intended audience because she works in teams to create effective robots. She has knowledge of MiTechFoods technology and why it may appeal to consumers and investors.

1. Have you ever invested in a restaurant?
No, not a restaurant but have used Doordash frequently.
1a. Have you ever invested in a restaurant like MiTechFood?

2. Does the idea of investing in MiTechFood appeal to you? Why or why not?
Yes appeals. Seems about the same. It doesn't appeal because of the novelty. She's been to a robot chef restaurant but it was underwhelming. She went with the robotics team in high shcool but was not significantly different from other restaurants. Called Spyce in Boston.
3. What is an important piece of information that you always want to know before investing in a company, brand or restaurant?
Models how they get people to buy food and how they are profitable over the long term. Maybe good because of its consistent quality. People may not have job opportunities. May be nice to slowly transition but places aren’t ready for that right now, people might not be upset.

4. When investing, is learning about your founders background important? Why or why not?
Yes she cares, very important. As a startup you aren’t going to have that many people so leadership should be good and have expertise in both technical in marketing and finance.

5. How long or how well do you have to know an individual or startup like MiTechFood before you would feel comfortable investing in them?
It depends on how much money she would invest. If it is a lot she would want to have a lot of familiarity and contact them frequently. She would like to have say and give her input, otherwise if she is a regular investor, if they had a stock or republic offering she wouldn’t need to know them personally.
6. Do you have any considerations or reservations, if any, about investing in MiTechFood? Why or why not?
No jobs for people in the community.

9. What haven’t I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?
- NA


**Interviewee 4:**

Jason Ng is a sophomore at Cornell University in Dyson. He is part of Cornell's Grub Venture. He is part of our intended audience because he is a potential investor with knowledge of investing in general, as well as investing in the food industry. Grub Ventures specifically focuses on impacting the food and agriculture industry. They also partner with food, technology, and agriculture focused venture-capital firms. This works well since our audience is potential investors in MiFoodTech, which is a food+robotics startup company.

1. Have you ever invested before? Have you ever invested in a restaurant?

Yes

- looking to invest into cryptocurrency mining (specifically Bitcoin or Script mining). Miners are called ASIC miners, specialized computers used only for mining
    - feel like cryptocurrency is in a rise, many companies using cryptocurrency as a form of transaction (eg. Tesla), also very passive, you set it up and don’t have to worry about it anymore.
- been investing into index funds. Index funds are a stock that owns multiple shares of other companies. (eg. S&P 500). the safest way to increase your ROI(return on investment). For example, if one company tanks and goes bankrupt, there’s still 499 other companies.

- never invested in a restaurant before
- I have invested into a restaurant chain stock known as Yum China - company that owns brands such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell in China.
- the stock has so far been declining a bit due to covid in China.

1a. Have you ever invested in a restaurant like MiTechFood?
N/A
1b. If yes, what did you invest in most recently and why?
N/A

2. Did you seek out any information before deciding to invest?  If yes, what was that information? How did you obtain it?

Yes

- for crypto mining, did a lot of research via youtube or asking one of my friends who does GPU mining
- used youtube to find ways to optimize mining through specific outlets that need to be configured at my “house”, as well as the most optimal/efficient miners available in 2021.
- beforehand i didn’t know about index funds. i just started investing around 2 years ago. i watched youtube videos from this guy named Graham Stephen. he emphasized the pros and cons of index funds vs owning stock in one company.
- i want to invest in a safe and passive way==> index funds are safest way for me because i didn’t want to actively manage my stock portfolio

2a. What is the most important piece of information that influenced your decision to invest?

- Time Value of Money ==> i realized that the idea of TVM and compound growth plays a huge part when investing young vs older
- investing money at 18 vs 40, amount much greater earlier than at later time
- at young age, don't have same risk as parents,  important to risk as much as possible when i don’t have anything to lose

2b.  How did you feel about the {business, company, startup, etc} you decided to invest in?

- i felt that there could be a potential for growth and it was a worth wild investment for the future even if it ended up not working.
- eg. my investment into bitcoin miners since there is still a possibility that it could crash tomorrow. i was willing to risk the initial investment to buy the hardware needed. I felt that there was a safe place to simply store my money without fear of it being consumed by inflation.

3. Is there any information you wish you had known about your investment beforehand or information you weren’t able to find?

- for both investments ==> i wish i would’ve entered the market earlier. bitcoin prices have skyrocketed to around 61,000 and just 2 years ago, it was only 8000. stocks prices, QQQ 2 years ago was worth 200 while now it is at 400.

4. (Optional) Does the idea of investing in MiTechFood appeal to you? Why or why not?

- MiTechFood does sound like an appealing investment for me. robots could be applied to the whole restaurant industry and not just Chinese food
- With the high demand in restaurant food and low supply of workers in the workforce, I believe that the next step to combating the rise of unemployment from the pandemic is robot workers for the restaurant industry. also solves the issue regarding sanitation issues within the industry from COVID-19.

5. What is an important piece of information that you always want to know before investing in a company, brand or restaurant?

- important information that I look at before investing into a company:
- their overall growth in the past 5 years
- financial statements to analyze if they are in debt or profit
- their future ventures that they are attempting to make.
==> it allows me to throughly see if they would utilize my investment for the growth of the company.

6. When investing, is learning about your investees background important? Why or why not?

- For the most part yes, I can have a full scope of what I am getting into.
- eg. with current markets of cryptocurrency regarding the shiba coin, most investees are children trading off of their parents accounts therefore ==> would categories that type of investment a high risk and most likely a lost for me.  

7. (Optional) How long or how well do you have to know an individual or startup like MiTechFood before you would feel comfortable investing in them?

- it would mostly likely require a lot of research and analysis before investing into it.
- plan everything out for around 3 months before pulling the trigger.
- eg. when I learned about crypto mining, it took me time to research the current industry, miners, and future profitability if the market plummets tomorrow.

8. Do you have any considerations or reservations, if any, about investing in MiTechFood? Why or why not?

- Some considerations I have about investing in MiTechFood is the possibility that it can’t grow outside of the Chinese food industry
- if it can’t then their potential growth for the future will decline ==> I think that if it can grow into the fast food industry...it would be a high return investment if the robots can accomplish jobs more efficiently than workers.

9. What haven’t I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

- with stocks, fair warning that there could be a crash soon due to how the economy is shaped from high inflation and a rise in real estate, stocks, and gas prices

**Interviewee 5:**

Oliver Chung is a junior student attending DigiPen Institute of Technology, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in game design. He falls under our target audience, because one of his general interests and hobbies include investments and stocks. He was also involved with cryptocurrency at some point in the past.

1. Have you ever invested before? Have you ever invested in a restaurant?
    - Have you ever invested in a restaurant like MiTechFood?
    - If yes, what did you invest in most recently and why?
    - If not, ...

Have invested in the past, but not in a restaurant. The most recent investment was for Apple and Amazon because they seemed "reliable" bets compared to other candidates, also had the suggestion of a friend.

2. Did you seek out any information before deciding to invest?  If yes, what was that information? How did you obtain it?
    - What is the most important piece of information that influenced your decision to invest?
    - How did you feel about the {business, company, startup, etc} you decided to invest in?

Did seek out information before investing, the information was obtained through observing and organizing various stock prices. The most important piece of information was another suggestion from his dad. At the time of the investment, he felt satisfied with his choices because they were safe choices and seemed to promise profit from their past prices.

3. Is there any information you wish you had known about your investment beforehand or information you weren’t able to find?

One information that he wish he had known about more is the concept of hedge funds, knowing and being aware of more details would have helped and possibly changed his initial decisions about investments, no particular information that he wanted to find but could not at the time

4. (Optional) Does the idea of investing in MiTechFood appeal to you? Why or why not?

While robotics have shown general development, he is not particularly appealed with the idea of investing in MiTechFood, because he knowns and has personal experience with investments in restaurants being comparably more volatile and therefore unstable, but idea of MiTechFood itself is appealing nonetheless.

5. What is an important piece of information that you always want to know before investing in a company, brand or restaurant?

The past activities and price values of the companies are the most crucial information that he prioritizes before making investments, because while making entirely accurate predictions is difficult he can somewhat deduce whether or not the investment will be profitable by looking at past trends, the more detailed the spanned out the information, the better

6. When investing, is learning about your investees background important? Why or why not?

Definitely important, because investees are part of the company you'd be investing for and they will in one way or the other affect the furture trends of the company itself, especially if they're a representative or a director

7. (Optional) How long or how well do you have to know an individual or startup like MiTechFood before you would feel comfortable investing in them?

For restaurants, you'd need at least about five years to know that they are doing well before you can start looking into actually investing for the company like MiTechFood

8. Do you have any considerations or reservations, if any, about investing in MiTechFood? Why or why not?

No for reasons already mentioned, because restaurant investments tend to be more volatile and riskier than an electronics company, for example

9. What haven’t I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above. List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: differentiate MiFoodTech
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Have either a page or an infographic/table dedicated to comparison between MiFoodTech and other similar companies
  - This image should be the primary content of the page for ease of reading purposes and because this is such an important thing for most users
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Many of the user interviewees noted that if they were putting their money somewhere, they would want to know what makes this company unique and therefore likely to suceed. Interviewee 1 specifically said that she would need the company to be wildly different from any incumbents as that would signify the possibility of capturing a niche to her.

Goal 2: understand the market/industry
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_  
  - Have a page dedicated to "what is foodtech?" that we can include the content from Mi's slides on so that users can get good background on the industry
  - This can also introduce incumbents that MiFoodTech is seeking to disrupt
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._

## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

**Plan your site's content.**

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List the content you plan to include your personal website. This should be a comprehensive list.

- Company Background
- Problems (covid-19, employment, etc)
- Solution (their product)
- Team member bios
- Robot Technology (description of wok robot)
- Customer acquisition strategy
- Future plans and milestones
- Customer acquisition strategy
Images:
- Market size graph
- Industry outlook graph
- Automatic wok image
- Milestones graphic
- Appealing images of chinese food
- Headshots of team members
- Wages as a share of revenue graph
- Cooking shredded potatoes graphic
- Competitor benchmarking table
- Labor costs table


### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how its addressed their goals..

Our content is appropriate and addresses user goals. It the user needs by demonstrating to the intended audience how unique MiTechFoods is as a Chinese restaurant that employs robot technology. This is a revolutionary method in food service and is not only more sanitary, especially in COVID-19 times, but also more efficient. To get this across to users the site includes many images and descriptions of the robot technology and how it is beneficial to consumers. Content about how this niche area of interest is competitive against its competitors and why it will succeed in the long run is detailed through graphs and more infographics and text. These images, graphs and text descriptions all point to the novelty and value of MiTechFood and will effectively appeal to investors looking to make money.
Additionally, a textual background on this restaurant industry will be provided to give investors and better idea of the market/industry. Founder and team member backgrounds will also be provided to give investors confidence about the team’s abilities, experience, and knowledge in this industry setting. It will demonstrate to investors how MiTechFood has the potential to disrupt the industry and will thrive, creating incentive for investors to put  resources toward growing this startup. It also gives them a better sense of the people behind the business and what motivates them to pursue their goals.

Furthermore, stats and numbers on how MiTech Food compares to its competitors will also be provided in large text in bullet points. This draws investor attention to the numbers and will show them how promising MiTechFood is and their projection in the long run. It again drives how unique this company is and what they have to offer to the restaurant industry.

The content addresses learning about who works at MiFoodTech because we included content that has the team members, their information, images of each team member, and the company history. We are including company background, team member bios, and team member bios. This will allow investors to get familiar more with the company  and help them understand the team at MiFoodTech.

Our content will also address learning about the product and business plan because we include information about their plan, as well as many images, graphics, and tables on MiFoodTech’s plan. We include a description of the robot technology that the company is working on. For example, there is a description of the wok robot. We are including an image of the automatic wok, as well as a diagram of how a robot would cook shredded potatoes. This information will help investors learn about the product the MiFoodTech is developing and how it will work. The content includes the customer acquisition strategy, future plans and milestones, milestones graphic, industry outlook graph, and labor costs table. These pieces of information will help investors learn about the business plan and provide the information that will help them decide if they want to invest in the company.

The content will address the goal of learning about company history because we include MiFoodTech’s information on Chinese businesses in the U.S. and why the company started, and its purpose. The information we include is the company background, problems, solutions, and a graphic of wages. This will help investors to understand the motivation of the company, and their overall purpose, which is a huge part of the company history.



## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your iterations of card sorting here.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting and description of your thought process for each iteration.

1. First Iteration of Cardsorting
![First Iteration of Cardsorting](/design/cardsort1.png)

We grouped content into 5 categories: background, about the team, about the robot/technology, the industry, and future plans. The wages graph is part of the background since it can illustrate the context of MiFoodTech's solution. The industry outlook section includes the competitor benchmark and customer acquisition strategy since many of our user interviewees were interested in understanding the market and viability of the startup before investing. The future plans include labor costs because that content could show the effectiveness of MiFoodTech's product by demonstrating the estimated benefits of implementing MiFoodTech in a restaurant.

2. Second Iteration of Cardsorting
![Second Iteration of Cardsorting](/design/cardsort2.png)
-sorted into 5 distinct sections: about the company, team background, industry advantages, robot technology, and future plans
-the sorting is logical and help create distinct focuses for each web page
-pages will have an appropriate amount of content which features images and graphs provided by MiTechFood to best illustrate what their startup can offer

3. Third Iteration of Cardsorting
![Third Iteration of Cardsorting](/design/cardsort3.png)
The five categories from the second iteration are maintained, except the specific contents of robot technology, problems and solutions, and automatic wok image are swapped between their previous categories. As such, we also maintain the same extent of distributing the information across the pages; the only change that have occurred is swapping the scope of the company background page and the robot/technology webpage. What this achieves is a bit more narrow and specific presentation of content from the company background, and a wider and general portrayal of content for the technology webpage.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

TODO

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences and their goals.

TODO


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your personal website navigation.

- Home
- Team
- What is FoodTech?
- Why Us?
- Future


> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience and their goals.

These names make sense for the site's audience, because each name appropriately categorizes the user's goals. For the potential investors who are thinking on making investments and thus wishing to find out how MiTechFoods differs from other companies, they would navigate to the "Why Us?" webpage. Similarly, for investors who are more curious to see who and what kind of people are involved, they would navigate to the "Team" webpage, and so on. In other words, each name of the webpages semantically correspond to the goals that we have already identified as the user's goals when they visit our website.



## Design (Milestone 2)

### Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.
> Note the theme you selected for you site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

Theme 1: Clean and Bright
- Appropriate because it matches the kind of website that Mi gave us as examples
- Also matches startup/robotics energy - looks modern and sleek
- Sans Serif Font (looks modern)
- 2-3 Accent colors
    - Keeps the theme interesting but not too busy
- Big Font, lots of space in between lines
    - Mi's examples all have lots of white space
    - Easier to read for potential investors
- Combination of circular and square images
    - We don't have a lot of content so this will keep the website interesting

Theme 2: Geometric
- Appropraite because it is futuristic and matches the robot logo
- Sans Serif Font (looks modern)
- Sharp edges (rectangle pictures)
    - structured like robotics
- Darker colors
    - to emphasize contrast
    - Easier to read for potential investors
- Compact font (less space between lines)
    - looks like explicit shapes/rectangles to match the images

Theme 3: Homey/Rustic
- Appropraite because restaurants and chinese food are comforting
- Bold/Jewel tone colors
    - less white space (because white space feels cold)
- warmer, more welcoming and inviting feeling
    - Evokes emotion in potential investors that might influence them towards investing
    - Sentimental value and positive association
- Serif or Monospace Font (rustic)
- No circular images (They look too modern and would leave too much white space)

We chose Theme 1, mainly because its features most resembled the examples that we were provided with from our client. As such, Theme 1 rests closest with the direction to which our client wants us to design our website, with respect to its theme. Furthermore, the features from Theme 1 best fit the idea of a startup company, as compared to those from Theme 2 and 3.

### Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 2)
> Brainstorm several ideas for your site's interactivity.
> Provide a very brief summary how each idea improves the usability of the site for the site's audience.

- Hamburger menu for mobile site (all pages)
    - ease of use when tapping with fingers because menu expands
- Hovering/Clicking on sections of graphs/images provide explanation of what that section is (market outlook page)
    - less scrolling when trying to figure out what certain areas mean
- Carousel for robot (why us page)
    - easy to see how robot moves/is used which would be helpful to investors
- Modal design pattern (team page)
    - when you click on an image of someone, that person's bio shows up
    - easy to learn more details about a specific team memver
- Drop down timeline (future page)
    - titles of stages on timeline and when you click on each stage the drop down with more details shows up
    - useful for investors to see bigger picture before looking for more details
- Hover on timeline titles (future page)
    - titles of stages on timeline, when you hover over the details show up
    - useful for investors to see bigger picture before looking for more details
- Timed Carousel of lots of chinese food pictures (home page)
    - clearly communicates what we are trying to make
    - dynamic and interesting

### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the mobile and desktop versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

#### Home Page (Michelle)

![First Iteration of Desktop Home Page](/design/homeDesk1.jpg)
Sketch 1: This sketch makes use of a carousel to display the images of Chinese food that MiFoodTech aims to produce. This gives the audience of investors a sense of the end goal and can increase the appeal of the company by bringing the end product into the forefront of the page. I tried to break up the company background, problems, and solution paragraphs of content with images to the right of the text, leveraging the way in which our audience reads from left to right by keeping the content on the left side.

![Second Iteration of Desktop Home Page](/design/homeDesk2.jpg)
Sketch 2: I had the company background be the first content the audience would read about on the page with images of Chinese food on the right. I attempted to make use of white space by centering the problems content and solution content. The image next to the solution content would be an image of the robot technology of MiFoodTech and provide the audience an immediate visual of the product after reading about it.

![Third Iteration of Desktop Home Page](/design/homeDesk3.jpg)
Sketch 3: This sketch includes a full-width image of Chinese food and makes use of white space for the company background, problems, and solution sections by having the content be centered on the page without taking up the whole width of the page. I also added a contact information footer at the bottom of the page.

![Fourth Iteration of Desktop Home Page](/design/homeDesk4.jpg)
Sketch 4: In this sketch I explored removing the full-width image and just having the content be formatted with the image to the right and the text on the left. This looked too column-like and was difficult to think of ways to add interactivity but leverages common design patterns in the placement of the content.

![Fifth Iteration of Desktop Home Page](/design/homeDesk5.jpg)
Sketch 5: In this iteration I incorporated a full-width timed slideshow of food images right under the navigation bar to capture the attention of potential investors and give them a sense of the vision of MiFoodTech's solution. I organized the company background and solution such that the text content is on the left, and the image on the right to leverage the left-to-right reading of our audience. I included a short quote on the left side of the problems content to highlight the key issue that MiFoodTech solves. There is also a footer with contact information on the bottom of the page so that potential investors can reach out to Mi with questions or express their interest in investing.

![First Iteration of Mobile Home Page](/design/homeMobile1.jpg)
Mobile sketch: The navigation bar is replaced with a hamburger menu that expands when tapped on with the navigation bar; this is a common design pattern used on mobile devices since it is easier to tap on full-width buttons on smaller devices. The content is the same as the fifth iteration of the desktop page, but is instead oriented such that the content is stacked in one column. This aligns with existing design patterns due to the limited screen width of mobile devices.

#### Market/Industry Outlook Page (Claire)
