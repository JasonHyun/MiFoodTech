# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remoce or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

We want to be finished  with the milestone the day before.


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

  - Commit messages include what we changed (use action verbs ie added, changed, etc)
  - Status updates in gc: send something before & after project work (ex: before - I am planning to work on ... in ... file; after: I pushed ... that included ... changes)
    - Text in gc when stuff doesn’t work

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - meet (ideally in person) at least 1x a week; communicate through Messenger

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - communicate via email, work with client via Zoom meetings + email (update after first client mtg)

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    Meeting creator: Danielle
    - sets up LettuceMeet on Wednesdays for group project work times

    Client liaison: Michellle
    - point person for emails with client; respond within 24 hours

    Secretary: Melissa
    - takes notes during meetings with client  

    Content organizer: Jason
    - collect and organize content from client

    TODO: Role: Claire
    - description

    potential roles:
    - github submitter
    - meeting agenda planner:
      - comes up with what we want to get done during a work session / mtg + sends in gc before mtg so everyone is on the same page
      - writes a post-mtg summary right after mtg + action items for team members
        - that is, write brief bullet points of what we did (in case someone wasn't able to make the mtg) + next steps for each team member


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    TODO

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    vote, majority wins

8. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    TODO


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
