<h2> Test Restaurant</h2>
<p>
  To test our technologies in the real world, we plan to open a test restaurant with our technologies in Ithaca next summer. The test restaurant is called TANR (摊儿). It means “booth” in Chinese. This restaurant pitches itself as a fast-casual Chinese food restaurant. Our target dine-in customers are employees working in downtown office buildings, downtown visitors, and residents (mainly Cornell students) living in the surrounding neighborhood. We will also provide delivery for Cornell students and locals.
